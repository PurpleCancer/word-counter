## Solution structure:
- `WordCounter.Common`: interface definition shared between the implementations
- `WordCounter.CSharp` and `WordCounter.FSharp`: interface implementations in C# and F#, respectively
- `WordCounter.Tests`: unit tests
- `WordCounter.ConsoleApp`: command line program (to be compiled and launched from the terminal)
